# base

This is a project to work from for building native macos apps. It opens a MetalKit-based window and sets up a couple of callbacks for the main game loop.

It's been made with as much of a Handmade philosophy as I could manage.

It is FAR from perfect, but it's a start.

To get going, just clone it, navigate to the code/ directory, and run build.sh.
